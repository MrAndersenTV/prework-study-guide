            <li>The head element is a container for meta elements</li>
            <li>meta elements contain info about the page used by the browser</li>
            <li>The user does not see head or meta elements</li>
            <li>"Child" elements are elements nested inside another element</li>
            <li>The "parent" element is the element that holds the "child" elements</li>
            <li>For example, a "body" element that holds "h1," "h2," and a "p" element is the parent element. The elements inside the body are the child elements</li>
            <li>Elements and tags are sometimes used interchangibly</li>
            <li>However, elements contain the opening and closing tags. If someone refers to a tag as an opening or closing tag, there is a distinction.</li>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>

            <li>The following shows an example of a CSS rule:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The "div" is an example of the selector. A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations apply</li>
            <li>Each declaration contains a property and a value. The property is the CSS property we want to apply, and then the value defines what it looks like.</li>
            <li>A CSS selector with multiple declarations is called a declaration block.</li>
            <li>The CSS box model shows how margins, borders, padding, and content within an HTML element (see image below)</li>
            <li>Margins determine how much space is on the outside of an element. It is NOT visible.</li>
            <li>Padding is often confused with margin but isn't the same. Padding adds space INSIDE the element.</li>
            <li>Adding padding increases the size of the element because the padding is located INSIDE The element.</li>
            <li>DRY stands for Do Not Repeat Yourself. A coding principle is to encourage developers to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines in code. This reduces the size and complexity of the code.</li>
            <li>Using a percentage rather than a pixel measurement addresses the percentage of the available width of the webpage.</li>

                <li>Here are some important ones to remember</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
                    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch AND switches to it</li>
                    <li>git pull branch-name: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
                    <li>git push [alias] [branch]: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository</li>
                    <li>Here are the steps to add, commit, and push up the code, then open and merge a pull request:</li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>To save the current feature to GitHub, in Git Bash or the Terminal (for mac) type [git add-A]. the "-A" stands for "Add" and this stages the changes we made.</li>
                      <li>To commit the code to our repo, type [git commit -m "added CSS to project". the "-m" stands for "merge" and the area in quotes adds notes to the commit.</li>
                      <li>We can then type [git pull origin main] to ensure our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>
                      <li>To push up all of our changes, enter [git push origin feature/add-css]</li>
