            <li>The head element is a container for meta elements</li>
            <li>meta elements contain info about the page used by the browser</li>
            <li>The user does not see head or meta elements</li>
            <li>"Child" elements are elements nested inside another element</li>
            <li>The "parent" element is the element that holds the "child" elements</li>
            <li>For example, a "body" element that holds "h1," "h2," and a "p" element is the parent element. The elements inside the body are the child elements</li>
            <li>Elements and tags are sometimes used interchangibly</li>
            <li>However, elements contain the opening and closing tags. If someone refers to a tag as an opening or closing tag, there is a distinction.</li>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The following shows an example of a CSS rule:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>div {color: blue; text-align: justify;}</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The "div" is an example of the selector. A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations apply</li>
            <li>Each declaration contains a property and a value. The property is the CSS property we want to apply, and then the value defines what it looks like.</li>
            <li>A CSS selector with multiple declarations is called a declaration block.</li>
            <li>The CSS box model shows how margins, borders, padding, and content within an HTML element (see image below)</li>
            <li>Margins determine how much space is on the outside of an element. It is NOT visible.</li>
            <li>Padding is often confused with margin but isn't the same. Padding adds space INSIDE the element.</li>
            <li>Adding padding increases the size of the element because the padding is located INSIDE The element.</li>
            <li>DRY stands for Do Not Repeat Yourself. A coding principle is to encourage developers to reuse or share pieces of code to reduce the number of lines in code. This reduces the size and complexity of the code.</li>
            <li>Using a percentage rather than a pixel measurement addresses the percentage of the available width of the webpage.</li>

            <li>Enter your GIT notes here:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are a ton of git commands to rememeber</li>

                <li>Here are some important ones to remember</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
                    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch AND switches to it</li>
                    <li>git pull branch-name: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>
                    <li>git push [alias] [branch]: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository</li>
                    <li>Here are the steps to add, commit, and push up the code, then open and merge a pull request:</li>
                    <ol>
                      <li>To save the current feature to GitHub, in Git Bash or the Terminal (for mac) type [git add-A]. the "-A" stands for "Add" and this stages the changes we made.</li>
                      <li>To commit the code to our repo, type [git commit -m "added CSS to project". the "-m" stands for "merge" and the area in quotes adds notes to the commit.</li>
                      <li>We can then type [git pull origin main] to ensure our current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.</li>
                      <li>To push up all of our changes, enter [git push origin feature/add-css]</li>
                    </ol>
                  </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript adds interactivity to websites.</li>
            <li>API stands for Application Programming Interfaces</li>
            <li>Unlike the CSS code to add CSS to the HTML doc, the code to add JavaScript to your html file goes in the "body" element. We will use the "script" opening and closing tags with the "src" attribute linking the script file to your code.</li>
            <li>In JavaScript (and CSS), the semicolon marks the end of a statement.</li>
            <li>The following are core features of the language:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables: containers that store values. "Let" is used to declare a variable's value. Each variable can have different data types:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>String: sequence of text. Enclosed in double or single quote marks.</li>
                <li>Number: Pretty obvious...but numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
                <li>Boolean: True/False value. These words do not need quotes either.</li>
                <li>Array: A structure that lets you store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
                <li>Object: Can be anything because everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. the above data types can be considered objects.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Operators: mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables. Here are some examples of operators:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Addition (+): Adds two numbers together OR combines two strings.</li>
                <li>Subtraction (-)/Multiplication (*)/Division (/): Do exactly what they do in basic math.</li>
                <li>Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.</li>
                <li>Strict equality (===): Tests to see if two values are equal AND of the same data type. It returns a Boolean result.</li>
                <li>Not (!), Does-not-equal (!==): Returns the logically opposite value of what it tests. It turns a true into a false, etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Conditionals are code that test if an expression is true or not. The most common conditional structure is the "if...else" statement.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The expression after the "if" is the test. If the test is true, it runs the first block of code after the "if" expression. If the test is false, it runs the block of code after the "else" expression.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Functions: Allow us to store and package functionality or code that we wish to reuse. This reduces the amount of code we have to repeat.</li>
              <li>Within functions, there can be a return statement. This statement returns the result variable out of the function so it can be used. This is called varioable scoping.</li>
              <li>Events: Also called "event handlers." This is where real interactivity comes to a website. The event handler listens for activity in the browser and runs code in response.</li>
              <li>In order to code an event, you must select an element, then assign the function. The most common event handler function is "addEventListener()".</li>
              <li>After assigning the function, you pass the name of the event for the code to listen for (for example: "click") and add a functio nto run when the event happens.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For example: document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", function() {alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!");});</li>
                <li>Since the "function ()" doesn't have a name, this is called an anonymous function. We can also write anonymous functions using an arrow function that looks like this: () =></li>
                <li>The "const" variable keyword is used to lock down what the variable will be when declared. It cannot be reassigned a value later.</li>
              </ul>  
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
